## Balatro Game Tracker

https://a4-silas-joy.glitch.me/

For this project, I made a score tracker for the game Balatro. In the game, there are a variety of different decks and difficulties (stakes) you can play with. The score you receive in the game is based on two factors: chips and mult, your final score is these two numbers multiplied together. To use the app, you simply have to enter in your final chips and mult, as well as the deck and stake you played on, and it will save that information and calculate your final score For CSS positioning, I used a flex container to keep the elements in a column

I was unable to add the Github Authentication, however the application still works with the same features as before.
